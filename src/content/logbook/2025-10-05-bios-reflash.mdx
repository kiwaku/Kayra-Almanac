Fighting back-feed voltage, the Pin-8 isolation hack, and forcing a write.

<br />

### The Setup

* **Target Chip:** Winbond 25Q128JVSQ (3.3V, 128 Mbit, SOP8).
* **Tool:** CH341A (Black PCB) configured as **25-series SPI**.
* **Prep:** PSU switch OFF, power cord removed. ATX 24-pin and EPS 8-pins physically unplugged to prevent 3.3V rail back-feed.

### The "Phantom Voltage" Problem

Even with the PSU off, the CH341A was struggling. The motherboard standby rail was "fighting" the programmer, leading to consistent errors:

* **Symptom:** Chip detection failed ("No Device Found") or identified as wrong capacity (25Q64).
* **Symptom:** Inconsistent read dumps (`backup1.bin` vs `backup2.bin` mismatch at address `0x3F0000+`).

### The Fix: Pin 8 Isolation

The board's auxiliary circuits were pulling power from the clip.

**The Hack:** I applied **Kapton tape** to cover **Pin 8 (VCC)** on the motherboard-side header. This forced the chip to be powered *solely* by the CH341A clip, isolating it from the board's hungry power rail.

### The Flash Procedure

Once isolated, the workflow stabilized:

1. **READ #1 & #2:** Saved two backups. Compared hashes—**Match**.
2. **ERASE:** Wiped the chip.
3. **WRITE:** Flashed specific image `ZX-DU99D4 V1.12` (Exact PCB revision match is critical).
4. **VERIFY:** Passed.

**Post-Flash:**
removed clip, cleared CMOS (battery pull for 3 mins), and reconnected power.
