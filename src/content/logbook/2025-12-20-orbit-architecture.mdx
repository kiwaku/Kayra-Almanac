Stage 1 architecture decisions, antenna selection rationale, and RF chain design.

# 2025-12-25 — ORBIT-RXTX: Architecture, Antenna Pivot, and RF Plumbing
[hardware, rf, satellite, leosat, antennas, rxtx, nanovna] · project: orbit-rxtx

This log records the main design decisions and the pivot away from DIY cross-yagi attempts. The project page stays clean; this is the reasoning archive.

## 1) Kickoff: What I actually want
Goal: a disciplined LEO ground station that is showable even before TX.
- Stage 1: RX-first + measurement + tracking + logs
- Stage 2: licensed full-duplex with a TX-safe RF chain (linear transponder capable)

Key constraint: I refuse to build a “mid-tier ham stunt”. The artifact is the system.

## 2) Original antenna plan (and why it was wrong)
Initial idea: buy two linear yagis per band and “combine into cross-yagi”.

Why this breaks down physically:
- A true cross-yagi has a controlled geometry and a single, well-defined phase center.
- Two separate booms mounted near each other do not magically become one antenna system.
- The “good” DIY examples online usually *remove one boom* or transplant elements onto a single boom → i.e., they’re actually building a real cross-yagi, not bolting two complete yagis together.

Conclusion: continuing this path would likely produce a non-reproducible antenna with unknown polarization purity.

Decision: stop being romantic about DIY and buy proven CP designs.

## 3) Final antenna selection
### 70 cm: U7V4 Cross Yagi (directional, CP)
Why:
- high gain where it matters for downlink SNR
- tracking + gain is the cleanest way to get showable RX results

Connector: SO-239 (female)

### 2 m: Nagara QFH144 (omni, CP)
Why:
- polarization-mismatch loss is real and boring
- QFH is proven for LEO RX in Japan and doesn’t require aim for basic coverage
- 2 m becomes genuinely important once TX exists

Connector: N-type (female)

## 4) RF plumbing logic
Principle: one long low-loss run, short flexible pigtails at the mast.
- Main feedline: ~10 m 5D-FB / LMR-240 class (50Ω)
- Pigtails: RG316 (20–50 cm) for connector adaptation + strain relief
- Stage 1 switching: manual plug/unplug at the mast end (cheapest, lowest complexity)

Notes:
- Minimize adapter stack. Each adapter is a failure point and a loss point.
- NanoVNA is not optional if I want to claim “disciplined system”.

## 5) HackRF as TX: rejected
HackRF is an analysis tool, not a credible satellite uplink transmitter:
- output power is too low for uplink without a PA
- filtering/linearity/control becomes a compliance risk
- system complexity rises, credibility drops

Decision: Stage 2 TX will use an actual all-mode rig.

## 6) License plan (Japan)
Target: 第三級アマチュア無線技士
Reason: linear transponders demand SSB/CW/data. 4級 FM-only is not the goal.

Path: 養成課程講習会（国家試験回避ルート）

## 7) What “success” looks like (Stage 1)
Showable artifacts before TX:
- Doppler-corrected waterfall plots
- pass logs (time/frequency curves)
- tracking validation (signal peak vs pointing)
- measured RF chain (NanoVNA S11 + notes)

The payload is predictable. The system is the artifact.
