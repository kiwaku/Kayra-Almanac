NanoVNA S11 measurements on crossed dual-band Yagi. Indoor bench verification — calibration, band sweeps, and move-on decision.

<br />

## Hardware / setup

- **Antenna:** crossed dual-band Yagi (U/V sections)
- **UHF section:** 430–440 MHz (70 cm)
- **VHF section:** 143–146 MHz (2 m)
- **Physical size (spec):** L 128 cm, W 110 cm, 700 g
- **Power handling (spec):** 60 W
- **VSWR spec:** < 1.3
- **Connector chain:** antenna UHF (SO-239) → adapter chain → SMA
- **NanoVNA calibration standards:** SMA Open / Short / Load
- **Measurement location:** indoors (living room)

## Calibration

- **Calibration method:** Port 1 OSL (Open / Short / Load)
- **Calibration plane:** last accessible SMA point (before the SMA↔UHF adapter)
- **Post-cal sanity check:** with load connected, S11 ≈ −32 dB

**Calibration plane note:** OSL calibration was performed at the last accessible SMA reference plane. The SMA↔UHF (SO-239) adapter remained outside the calibrated path, so the plotted S11 includes a small residual contribution from that adapter/transition (typically a minor shift, most noticeable at UHF).

**Environment note:** Measurements were taken indoors. Nearby conductors (walls, ceiling, furniture, wiring) can detune the antenna slightly by changing its near-field loading, so small frequency shifts vs outdoor/balcony conditions are expected. (This note is for impedance only; reception performance must be validated outdoors.)

## S11 results

### UHF (70 cm)

- S11 ≤ −10 dB from ~410 MHz upward
- **Resonance dip:** sharp feature at ~420 MHz
- **Satellite region spot check:** 437 MHz, S11 ≈ −20 dB
- **Conclusion:** UHF matching is good across the satellite region (~435 MHz)

**Chronology:** Initial spot check indicated resonance around 437 MHz (S11 ≈ −20 dB). A later wide sweep confirmed broad usability (≥410 MHz stayed ≤ −10 dB) with a sharper feature around ~420 MHz. Minor variance between sweeps is expected due to measurement plane/adapter chain and indoor detuning; both sweeps indicate acceptable match across the 435 MHz region.

### VHF (2 m)

- 140–148 MHz shows S11 better than −10 dB
- **Resonance dip:** sharp feature at ~142 MHz
- **In-band reference:** 145.800 MHz, S11 ≈ −15 dB
- Tighter sweep curve is much smoother (stable, real response)

### Verdict

−15 dB at 145.8 MHz and broad ≤ −10 dB across VHF is usable for receive. UHF similarly meets the bar. Move on to operational receive testing (SDR + balcony placement) rather than further tuning.
