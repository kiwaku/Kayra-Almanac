# LEO Amateur Satellite Ground Station

> Modular LEO ground station for RX instrumentation and full-duplex satellite communication.  
> A staged build prioritizing RF discipline, measurable performance, and upgrade paths over novelty QSOs.

## Status
**Stage 1 (RX & Instrumentation): In progress**  
**Stage 2 (Two-way LEO / full-duplex): Planned (license + TX chain)**

---
<br />

## Project Overview
ORBIT-RXTX is a Japan-based LEO satellite ground station built as a *system*, not a stunt: tracking + RF plumbing + measurement + repeatable outputs. The build is staged so each subsystem is validated before investing in the next.

## Final System Architecture

### Antenna Suite
- **70 cm (primary downlink / high gain):** **U7V4 Cross Yagi** (directional, circular polarization)  
  *Purpose:* maximize SNR on UHF downlinks with tracking.
- **2 m (RX now / future uplink support):** **Nagara QFH144** (omnidirectional, circular polarization)  
  *Purpose:* reliable VHF reception without polarization mismatch; later supports uplink once TX exists.

### Tracking & Pointing
- **AntRunner Az/El rotator**  
  *Purpose:* exploit Yagi gain during passes; integrates with satellite tracking software.

### Receive Chain (Stage 1 Core)
- **RTL-SDR v2**  
  *Purpose:* downlink reception, Doppler-aware tuning, spectrum/waterfall capture, and pass logging.
- **NanoVNA (H4-class)**  
  *Purpose:* verify antennas, adapters, and feedline (SWR/return loss) before any TX-stage work.

### RF Infrastructure Principles
- **One long low-loss main feedline** (e.g., 5D-FB / LMR-240 equivalent, ~10 m typical home run)
- **Short RG316 pigtails at the antenna end**
- **Stage 1 switching:** manual plug/unplug between antenna pigtails (min cost, min loss)

## Key Design Decisions (Short)
### Why not DIY “cross-yagi from two separate yagis”?
A true cross-Yagi needs a correct, single phase center and controlled geometry. Converting two separate booms into a real cross-yagi usually requires dismantling/rebuilding (element transplant / drilling) and introduces phase/spacing errors and non-reproducible results.  
**Decision:** use proven commercial circularly polarized antennas.

### Why Stage 1 is RX-first
RX-first produces publishable artifacts immediately (waterfalls, Doppler curves, decoded telemetry, tracking validation) while deferring the most expensive commitments (TX radio + TX-safe RF chain + licensing).

## Project Stages

### Stage 1 — RX & Instrumentation (IN PROGRESS)
**Goal:** operational receive system with measured RF path.  
**Outputs (showable):**
- Doppler-corrected waterfall plots
- pass logs (time/frequency)
- tracking verification (Az/El + signal peak)
- decoded telemetry/data when available

### Stage 2 — Two-way LEO (PLANNED)
**Goal:** full-duplex two-way operation (linear transponder capable).  
**Requirements:**
- **Japan license target:** 第三級アマチュア無線技士（養成課程ルート予定）
- TX-capable VHF/UHF rig (two-radio architecture acceptable: SDR RX + separate TX)
- TX-safe plumbing (filters/duplexing strategy, RX protection, measurement discipline)

## Logs & Build Diary
Long-form build notes, experiments, mistakes, and tuning sessions are tracked separately here:

- **Build Logs:** /logs/orbit-rxtx/  
- **RF Measurements (NanoVNA):** /logs/orbit-rxtx/measurements/  
- **Cabling & Adapter Decisions:** /logs/orbit-rxtx/rf-plumbing/  
- **Stage 2 Planning (TX chain / license):** /logs/orbit-rxtx/stage-2/

> The project page stays clean and current; logs preserve the messy reality.

## Philosophy
This isn’t a novelty “talk to space” exercise. It’s a disciplined RF system where Doppler, polarization, gain, noise, and loss are treated as first-class engineering constraints.

**The payload is predictable. The system is the artifact.**
