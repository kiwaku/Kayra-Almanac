Minimal config POST attempts, b7 halt, DRAM training failure, and the decision to go deep on firmware.

<br />

### Session Goal: Minimal POST

**Log started: 06:57 UTC**
The objective was a simple "sanity check" power-on before full assembly. The rig is currently an open-frame bench with minimal variables:

* **Motherboard:** ZX-DU99D4 V1.12 (C612 chipset).
* **CPU:** Single Xeon E5-2650 v3 (Socket #1).
* **RAM:** 1×8 GB DDR4 RDIMM ECC 2133 (Crucial).
* **GPU:** Quadro P400 (Bus-powered).
* **Power:** Corsair HX1000i. **Critical:** Only the 24-pin and the EPS 8-pin for Socket #1 are connected.

### The "b7" Dead End

**10:20 — First Power-on.** Shorted `PWRBTN#` with a screwdriver.
Fans spin, board powers, but no video. The 7-segment debug display cycled transient codes:

`b0` (OEM pre-memory) → `53` (Memory init fail) → `b7` (Halt).

**Code b7 Definition:** "Memory Configuration Error / Unsupported DIMM."

<br />

### Troubleshooting (The "Dirty Work")

I spent the next two hours isolating variables. The behavior was stubborn:

* **10:35 — CMOS Clear:** AC off, 24-pin removed, `CLR_CMOS` shorted for 15s. Moved DIMM to slot B1.
* **Result:** `bD` → `bA` → `4F` → **b7 (Halt)**.
* **11:00 — Dual Channel:** Added second stick (A1+B1).
* **Result:** Same **b7**.
* **11:30 — Physical Inspection:** Reseated CPU. Visually inspected LGA2011-3 socket pads; no bent pins found.

### Diagnosis & Decision

The hardware seems physically fine (pads even, PSU good). The prevailing theory is **Firmware Incompatibility**. The ZX-DU99D4 V1.12 is notorious for shipping with BIOS versions that lack proper microcode or DRAM initialization tables for certain SPD configurations.

<br />

**Action:** Ordered **CH341A SPI Programmer + SOP8 Clip**.
**Plan:** In-circuit flash. I will not waste time swapping more RAM until I can verify the BIOS is a known-good version.
