Sentinel is an intelligent email processing engine designed to automate the identification of high-value opportunities within high-volume inboxes.
It combines Large Language Models (LLM) for context-aware extraction with semantic vector embeddings for personalized filtering, establishing a privacy-first local pipeline for managing professional leads.
The system operates as a headless background service, monitoring multiple accounts and delivering condensed, actionable intelligence directly to your primary inbox via automated daily summaries.
The system is designed not as a general-purpose email client, but as a focused research platform for automating the "search and filter" phase of professional networking.

## **System Output — Automated Opportunity Summary**

This image displays the final output of the Sentinel pipeline: a structured email summary. After the engine processes the configured source accounts, it compiles identified opportunities into a clean digest, including metadata like organization names, opportunity types, and relevance scores, sent directly to the user's recipient address.

### Capabilities map

This map outlines the core functionality provided by the current release, spanning ingestion, analysis, and data management.

#### Core capabilities

<details className="capability">
  <summary><span className="chevron">▸</span><strong>A) AI-Powered Extraction</strong> (LLM/DSPy)</summary>

- **Contextual Analysis:** Uses LLMs to distinguish actual opportunities like fellowships or grants from generic noise.
- **DSPy Orchestration:** Employs the DSPy framework for advanced prompt engineering and reliable LLM orchestration.
- **Entity Recognition:** Automatically extracts organization names, deadlines, and requirements using automated NER.
- **Provider Agnostic:** Supports multiple backends including Together AI and local Ollama instances.
</details>

<details className="capability">
  <summary><span className="chevron">▸</span><strong>B) Smart Filtering & Ranking</strong> (NLP/ML)</summary>

- **Semantic Similarity:** Uses Sentence-Transformers to compare email content against your "Interest Profile" using vector embeddings.
- **Adaptive Thresholding:** Implements cosine similarity scoring to rank opportunities and filter out low-relevance items.
- **Scoring Weights:** Configurable priority calculation based on time-sensitivity and user-defined interest weights.
</details>

<details className="capability">
  <summary><span className="chevron">▸</span><strong>C) Secure & Local Architecture</strong> (Privacy)</summary>

- **Local Processing:** All sensitive email data is processed on the local machine; no data is sent to external clouds for storage.
- **Credential Management:** Secure environment-based handling via `python-dotenv` to keep API keys and passwords out of source code.
- **Storage Integrity:** Uses Pydantic for strict data validation and schema enforcement within the local SQLite database.
</details>

<details className="capability">
  <summary><span className="chevron">▸</span><strong>D) Operational Infrastructure</strong> (Reliability)</summary>

- **Multi-Source Monitoring:** Simultaneously monitors distinct accounts across different providers like Gmail and Outlook.
- **Deduplication:** Prevents redundant processing of identical opportunities across different email threads.
- **Automated Validation:** Features a comprehensive test suite for validating IMAP/SMTP connections and system functionality.
</details>

### Build & Deployment

The engine is built for headless operation with local-first configuration.

- **Configurable Profiles:** `config/profile.json` manages interests, geographic preferences, and exclusion keywords.
- **CLI Management:** `cli.py` allows for interactive profile updates and manual keyword searches across the local database.
- **Workflow:** Ingestion → AI Analysis → Smart Filtering → Local Storage → Summarization.
